# Long Description
The world is not on track to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. If recent trends continue, the number of people affected by hunger would surpass 840 million by 2030.Food waste is a growing problem with increasing populations and issues through the value chain. It's estimated a staggering 32% of the food that we produce in the world goes to waste.Waste such as food scraps and yard waste usually easily ends up in landfills.We aim to reduce food waste with our idea and create a sustainable environment .


## Technology to the rescue
Technology has long been helping to hack world hunger. These days most conversations about tech’s impact on any sector of the economy inevitably involves artificial intelligence—sophisticated software that allows machines to make decisions and even predictions in ways similar to humans. Food waste tech is no different.


### What could our app do?
We built an app using python to scan the grcocery reciept of a user,Extract text details and analyse the expiry date of groceries and remind the user to use them before they go waste.

### Implementing Machine learning
These technologies range from machine vision that can spot when fruit is ready to be picked to algorithms that forecast demand in order to ensure users don’t overstock certain foods.In our app  we made use of ML code to predict if food is perishable or not using two parameters-moisture(in %) and temperature(in celcius). If the entered temperature is below 11°C the food is likely to get spoilt irrespective of it's moisture content. If the temperature is above 11 and the moisture content is below 15% then the food item may or may not be perishable. If the moisture content is above 15% and the temperature is above 11°C then the food is perishable. When the temperature is above 29°C the food would get spoilt irrespective of it's moisture content.

## Conclusion
It’s clear that waste reduction analytics is highly valuable to us. It has allowed us to utilize an under tapped resource: the produce data. Predicting what would expire soon and effective management og grocery at home could be a small step to solving the food waste issue.It would be a cost effective strategy to manage monthly expenses too.

 Finally, This app undoubtedly results in an environmental benefit and likely lead to Zero Hunger ensuring no food goes into the bin as well as no person stays hungry.
